# MediLocker: Medical Record Storage System

**Technologies Used**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) | spaCy, NLTK, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Project Overview
MediLocker is a medical record storage system designed to digitize and streamline the management of medical records using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and cloud services.

### Features:
- **Voice Prescription**: Physicians can dictate prescriptions, which are converted into digital text for easy storage and access.
- **SOAP Note Summarization**: Automated summarization of SOAP notes for faster documentation.
- **Database Storage**: Secure storage and management of medical records in a cloud-based database using Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

### Tools and Libraries:
- **spaCy**: Used for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract important medical entities from the records.
- **NLTK**: Assisted in NLP tasks such as tokenization and text processing.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Provided cloud infrastructure for securely storing medical records.
